<h3>Budget Tracker</h3>

<h5>Project Description</h5>

This Python program functions as a Budget Tracker designed to help users monitor and manage their spending across multiple categories. The goal is to prevent overspending by keeping track of expenses in a structured and organized way. Using dictionaries, loops, functions, and conditional logic, the program allows users to:

-Add expenses by category<br>
-View total spending<br>
-Check remaining balance per category<br>
-Receive automatic warnings when spending exceeds the set budget limits<br>

The project is intended not only to assist with personal financial management but to help users build stronger budgeting habits through clear feedback and financial awareness.
